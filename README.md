# 🚗 NEAT Self-Driving Car Simulation (Pygame + Python)

This project simulates a **self-driving car** using **NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies)** and **Pygame**. The car learns to drive on a given track using evolved neural networks, guided by radar sensors.

## 🎮 Features

- Self-driving car controlled by evolving neural networks
- Powered by the NEAT algorithm (via `neat-python`)
- Uses radar-based sensors for obstacle detection
- Dynamic fitness evaluation based on distance and survival
- Real-time rendering of car and sensor data
- Built-in track and car sprite rendering with collision detection

## 🧠 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pygame
- NEAT-Python (for neural network evolution)
- Math and trigonometry for sensor mechanics and movement
